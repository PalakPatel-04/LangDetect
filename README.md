# Language-detection-using-python
"Language Detection using Multinomial Naive Bayes: A Python script for identifying languages in text. It preprocesses data with CountVectorizer, trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes model, and allows user input for language prediction. Ideal for language identification tasks.

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates language detection using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. It preprocesses text data, trains the model, and predicts languages based on user input.

## Features

- Text preprocessing with CountVectorizer.
- Multinomial Naive Bayes for language classification.
- Interactive input for language detection.
- Data splitting for model evaluation.

## Usage

1. Load a labeled dataset.
2. Preprocess text data with CountVectorizer.
3. Split data into training and testing sets.
4. Train the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
5. Use the script to predict languages interactively.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy`.
3. Run the script with your dataset.
